Development of django CMS
#########################

django CMS is an open-source project, and relies on its community of users to
keep getting better.

You don't need to be an expert developer to make a valuable contribution - all
you need is a little knowledge of the system, and a willingness to follow the
contribution guidelines.

Remember that contributions to the documentation are highly prized, and key to
the success of the django CMS project.

Development is led by a team of **core developers**, and under the overall
guidance of a **technical board**.

All activity in the community is governed by our :doc:`code_of_conduct`.
